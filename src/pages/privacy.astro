    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective: {{DATE}}</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>HookAndDrop (“Service”) is operated by {{COMPANY_NAME}} (“we”, “us”). This Policy explains what we collect and how we use it.</p>

    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account data:</strong> email, display name (if you create an account with us).</li>
      <li><strong>TikTok connection data:</strong> access tokens, open_id, and basic profile as permitted by TikTok scopes you grant.</li>
      <li><strong>Content:</strong> videos you upload to our Service for processing and posting.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage:</strong> logs, device information, and diagnostics to operate and secure the Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Authenticate you and connect your TikTok account.</li>
      <li>Prepare and publish videos you choose to post.</li>
      <li>Operate, secure, and improve the Service; prevent abuse.</li>
      <li>Respond to support requests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sharing</h2>
    <p>We share data with processors that help us run the Service (e.g., hosting, analytics) under contracts that restrict their use. We do not sell personal data.</p>

    <h2>Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain access tokens and minimal metadata while your account is active. You may disconnect TikTok at any time, which revokes tokens. We delete uploaded videos from our systems after posting or within {{RETENTION_WINDOW}} days, whichever comes first, unless you choose to store them.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures (encryption in transit, restricted access). No system is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location (e.g., GDPR/CPRA), you may have rights to access, delete, or port your data. Contact <a href="mailto:privacy@hookanddrop.com">privacy@hookanddrop.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>The Service is not intended for children under 13 (or the minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect children's data.</p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update this Policy; we'll post the new effective date above.</p>
